#hello world

Hi. My name is Denver. I'm not from Denver. I'm from Minnesota, though I guess that could confuse some folks. 

I'm interested in data visualization, photography, writing, entrepreneurship, and just being real.

Just started learning git, python, ruby and javascript. I also have an interest in node.js for my world_map project. 

I live in the Tenderloin neighborhood in San Francisco, California. 

I look forward to collaborating on projects with other like-minded developers. 

cheers,

@denver
