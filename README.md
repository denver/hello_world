#hello world

Hi. My name is Denver. I'm not from Denver. I'm from Minnesota, though I guess that could confuse some folks. 

I'm interested in data visualization, photography, writing, entrepreneaurship, and just being real.

I live in the Tenderloin San Francisco, California. 

I look forward to collaborating on projects with other like-minded developers. 

cheers,

@denver
